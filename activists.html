			<h3>LUCAS LAROCHELLE</h3>
			<p class="activist-tittle"> Designer and Researcher</p>
			<p> Lucas is a designer and researcher whose work is concerned with queer digital cultures. They are best known for creating the community-generated digital map called Queering The Map. <br>
			<br>
			Lucas’s approach to design is particularly purpose-driven. “Rather than creating a finished product or finished design that a user engages with passively, I think about design in terms of leading an audience through an idea through the interaction of some kind,” says LaRochelle. <br>
			<br>
			When asked about the future of the design field, they state: “the idea of universal design is dying, thank God! It’s is being revealed to be a deeply classist, racist, sexist, homophobic, and ableist nightmare of an idea. So that gives me a lot of optimism in terms of discovering more ethical design practices.</p>

			<h4>ADVICE FROM LUCAS</h4>

			<p>“Think in public! Try out ideas. Be less concerned with the final product. Enjoy the testing and the process.”</p>

			<h3>MARC O’BRIEN</h3>
			<p class="activist-tittle">Climate Designer and Design Strategist </p>
			<p> Marc is a design strategist, creative facilitator, and professor at California College of the Arts who brings unique ideas to solve our climate crisis. He founded ClimateDesigners.org, a web-based community that provides knowledge and skills for creatives to take climate action. <br> <br>

			Marc is a faithful believer in the importance of involving community members when addressing societal issues. He explains that "the last thing we need is the idea of the white Saviour, or, you know, this idea of colonialism coming in and saying 'Hey, here's how you solve this thing….' The role of a designer, in this case, the facilitator, is not to lead those conversations is to not come up with the ideas yourself, but to create the conditions so that the people on the ground can come up with and develop those ideas together."</p>

			<h4>ADVICE FROM MARC</h4>

			<p>"While you're idle, while you're waiting in between projects, or whatever, seek out those solutions, seek out the challenges that can be solved, that should be solved."</p>

			<h3>KASIA DYBEK</h3>
			<p class="activist-tittle"> Visual Designer</p>
			<p> Kasia Dybek is a visual designer, and a Ringling College of Art and Design alum (class of 2013) with a background in service design and sustainable design. She currently works as a senior designer for Fjord, where she works with researchers, futurists, and specialists, merging design and strategy to address critical issues. <br> <br> 

			In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, she was at the forefront of designing a massive campaign for the National Health System in the UK, involving the mass design of pick-up testing kits for people in London. With almost no time, she had to make sure that the packaging design was as inclusive as possible, legible for all spectrums of vision, and understandable for all ages. As narrated by Kasia, “Nobody was thinking of this because it was emergency times. If it were not for designers, we would lack clarity in times of crisis. Designers are facilitators of information.”
			</p>

			<h4>ADVICE FROM KASIA</h4>

			<p>“Have interests outside of your work! Get to know what is happening in the world, read, do different things. Don’t just get yourself trapped in the design bubble, where you only hang out with designers and only talk about design.”</p>

			<h3>BEA PATARATA</h3>
			<p class="activist-tittle">Climate Designer and Design Strategist </p>
			<p> Bea is a multidisciplinary graphic designer and a Ringling College of Art and Design alum (class of 2021) with an undeterred passion for climate advocacy. She grew up in a small city in the north of Portugal, but at age 16, she moved to China to attend United World College Changshu. There, she developed a passion for people, their stories, and their struggles, inspiring her to lend her talents to social and environmental causes. <br> <br>
 
			Bea currently works at Earthrise studio, where she explores visual language's potential to communicate our climate crisis best. She thinks that "our collective future requires us to think creatively and progressively - visual communication and graphic design have a role to play in that." 
			</p>

			<h4>ADVICE FROM BEA</h4>

			<p>"There are so many people and organizations (and even brands) that are doing good things locally and globally. Just find the causes that mean the most to you and start offering your services and creating conceptual solutions. Your portfolio will attract the people in this same activism, progress, and change circles. But also reach out to those who you look up to; most of them (if not too busy) will be happy to engage with you." </p>
