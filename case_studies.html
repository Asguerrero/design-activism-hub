			<p >Queering the map is a platform that facilitates the digital archival of LBTQ+ stories in relation to geography. By placing markers in an interactive world map,  queer can record their life experiences in specific physical spaces.

				<button class="case-study-purple-button">Website </button>
			</div>
			<p>Designing motherhood is an extensive research initiative that studies human reproduction through the lens of design. Its central premise is that: while birth often brings great joy, making babies has been a complex enterprise led by patriarchal structures. By looking at iconic, archaic, and modern designed objects surrounding pregnancy and childbirth, this initiative has redefined the relationships between people and babies during the past century.</p>
